# Sensors data from the city of Aarhus, Danemark
The purpose of this work is to provide some data visualization for IOT sensors data.

source : **http://iot.ee.surrey.ac.uk:8080/datasets.html**
github page : **https://github.com/Vinspi/GD_UI**

All the application is bundled in the war, you can easily start it by typing `"java -jar tpsparql-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war"` or put it in your web server directory.

It's a maven project so you can also build the project by typing `"mvn package"`.

Once launched, data are accessible through the UI at **http://localhost:8090**, you can click on a marker on the map to retrieve, parse and show data.

You can also choose a period then click the **update** button to see weather data (pressure, humidity, temperature and wind speed).

**Warning :** you must wait for the data to be loaded on the server, otherwise the API endpoints will return an empty string. When data are loaded, the app show the following message in the console : "App ready".

## The API endpoints are :

| API endpoint                    | Method | Request example                                            | Results                                                                                                                                  |
