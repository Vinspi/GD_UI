# Sensors data from the city of Aarhus, Danemark
The purpose of this work is to provide some data visualization for IOT sensors data.

source : **http://iot.ee.surrey.ac.uk:8080/datasets.html**
github page : **https://github.com/Vinspi/GD_UI**

All the application is bundled in the jar, you can easily start it by typing "java -jar app.jar" or execute it with java if you are on a Windows system.

Once launched, data are accessible through the UI at **http://localhost:8090**, you can click on a marker on the map to retrieve, parse and show data.

You can also choose a period then click the **update** button to see weather data (pressure, humidity, temperature and wind speed).

## The API hitpoints are :

| API hitpoint                    | Method | Request example                                            | Results                                                                                                                                  |
